# Custom Media Device for Android

*其他语言版本： [简体中文](README.md)*

This open source sample project shows how to use the new MeidaIO interface provided in the SDK.

## Running the App
First, create a developer account at [Agora.io](https://dashboard.agora.io/signin/), and obtain an App ID. Update "app/src/main/res/values/strings_config.xml" with your App ID.

```
<string name="private_app_id"><#YOUR APP ID#></string>
```
## Integration mode
- The first step: download the **Agora Video SDK** from [Agora.io SDK](https://www.agora.io/en/download/). Unzip the downloaded SDK package and copy ***.jar** under **libs** to **app/libs**, **arm64-v8a**/**x86**/**armeabi-v7a** under **libs** to **app/src/main/jniLibs**.

- The second step: add the following dependency in the "app/build.gradle" file dependency property of this project (the example is added in this code):

  compile fileTree(dir: 'libs', include: ['*.jar'])


Finally, open project with Android Studio, connect your Android device, build and run.

Or use `Gradle` to build and run.

## Developer Environment Requirements
- Android Studio 2.0 or above
- Real devices (Nexus 5X or other devices)
- Some simulators are function missing or have performance issue, so real device is the best choice
